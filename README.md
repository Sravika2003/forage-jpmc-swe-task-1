Project Structure

Repository contains the following files:

- `README.md`: This file, containing an overview of the project.
- `client3.py`: The client script that queries stock data and computes ratios.
- `client_test.py`: Unit tests for `client3.py`.
- `server3.py`: The server script that simulates the market and serves stock data.
- `requirements.txt`: List of dependencies required to run the project.
- `test.csv`: Sample data file used by the server.

Setup Instructions

1. Clone the Repository:
    - Open a terminal or command prompt.

    - Navigate to the directory where you want to clone the repository.

    - Run the following command to clone the repository:

        - git clone https://github.com/theforage/forage-jpmc-swe-task-1.git
        - cd forage-jpmc-swe-task-1
2. Install Dependencies:
    - install the required dependies listed in the 'requirements.txt':
        pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Generate Test Data:
    - If the test.csv file is not present in the project directory, it will be generated by the server the first time it is run. You can also manually generate it by running a function within the server script.
    - Ensure the server script server3.py can access or generate 'test.csv'

Task Instuctions

    1. Implement Functions
        - Function: getDataPoint in client3.py:
            - Extract the stock symbol, bid price, and ask price from the quote.
            - Compute the price as the average of the bid and ask prices.
            - Return these values.
            def getDataPoint(quote):
                stock = quote['stock']
                bid_price = float(quote['top_bid']['price'])
                ask_price = float(quote['top_ask']['price'])
                price = (bid_price + ask_price) / 2
                return stock, bid_price, ask_price, price
        - Function: getRatio in client3.py:
            - Compute the ratio of price_a to price_b.
            - Handle division by zero.
                def getRatio(price_a, price_b):
                    if price_b == 0:
                        return None
                    return price_a / price_b

Running the Server

To start the server, open a terminal and navigate to the project directory. Run the following command:
    python server3.py

The server starts successfully and returns output like:
    HTTP server started on port 8080
    Screenshot of Output:
    ![Output of server 8080 running status](<Screenshot 2024-06-15 195855-2.png>)

Running the Client

Open another terminal and run the client script:
    python client3.py
    Screenshot of Output:
    ![Output of client.py program execution and running status](<Screenshot 2024-06-15 195855-1.png>)

Running the Tests

To verify the implementation, run the tests using the following command:
    python client_test.py
    Screenshot of Output:
    ![Output of client_test.py program execution and running status](<Screenshot 2024-06-15 195835-1.png>)

Example Output

Here is an example of the expected output when running client3.py:

Quoted ABC at (bid:120.48, ask:121.2, price:120.84)
Quoted DEF at (bid:118.72, ask:119.5, price:119.11)
Ratio 1.0145
